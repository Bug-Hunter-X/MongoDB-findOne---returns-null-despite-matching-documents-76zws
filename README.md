# MongoDB findOne() returns null despite matching documents

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using MongoDB's `findOne()` method: receiving a `null` result even when a matching document exists in the collection.  The cause of this issue isn't always immediately apparent and can result from several factors. The examples provided highlight potential causes and solutions.

**Scenario:**

A simple query using `findOne()` fails to retrieve the expected document.  Debugging might not reveal an obvious error in the query, but the result remains `null`.

**Potential Causes:**

* **Incorrect Query:** Typos in field names or unexpected data types in the query can prevent matches.
* **Case Sensitivity:**  If your query doesn't respect the case sensitivity of the field values, it can fail to match documents.
* **Projection Errors:** Issues with the projection object can impact the results, potentially resulting in null if the requested fields aren't present in the documents.
* **Data Type Mismatches:** Ensuring the data types in your query match those in your database is critical.  A mismatch will result in no matches found.
* **Indexes:** Missing or inefficient indexes can slow down the query, but won't directly cause null results. However, if the query is extremely inefficient, the system might misbehave and return unexpected results.

**Solutions:**

The provided solution file (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates the corrected approach for different error scenarios.  Careful attention to query construction and data validation is key to resolving these cases.
